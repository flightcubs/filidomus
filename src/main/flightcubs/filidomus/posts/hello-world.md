# Hello, World!

## Look mom, I'm on the internet.

As many others these days, I largely live in the digital world. I read digital books, browse reddit, and develop software as a profession. We all have digital footprints scattered all over the place. Facebook and Google knows us better than what our friends do. 

Recently I've started to have this nagging thought. I've never had a digital home. Sure, I have an email address and a Linkedin profile, but I'm merely renting the place. It's time for me to have my own little patch of land in this strange new world. It may not be much, but it's mine.

I'll keep this brief. This is not a grand entrance but a quite settling. The purpose of this page is to write about my journey of personal growth. Welcome to my humble abode.
