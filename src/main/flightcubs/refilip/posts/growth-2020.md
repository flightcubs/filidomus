# A year of growth

## Growth 2020
*Each month of this year, I will focus intensively on developing my skills and knowledge in a new subject.* 

This year long project is about self improvement and growth. The format is purposely designed to avoid being overwhelmed by learning too many things at once, and to force progress through planning and goal setting. 

During the year, I’ll continuously post about each learning project, and you can read about each one here:

1. January: TBD

## Format and philosophy
There are a few basic concepts for the format of this project:

* The purpose is to grow in a diverse range of subjects
* This challenge spans the entire year of 2020
* Each month is focused on a different subject
* The subjects should be evenly drawn from these groups of high level topics:
	* Health and body
	* Culture and arts
	* Intellect and mind
	* Other (what a cop-out, I know)
* The current experience in a subject does not matter - it is the relative growth that is important
* Most subjects should preferably have some practical application, to avoid it only being about acquiring knowledge
* Actually practicing/doing the subject and learning through experience is more important than learning about the subject

By focusing on one subject at the time, I hope to be able to really immerse myself and benefit from rapid learning. A short time limit also makes it less daunting, as each endeavour will “only be for a month”. I’ve often found myself spread too thin, trying to learn many things at once or start with several new habits at the same time. This not only makes it harder to get a continuity in the learning, but makes it easy to stay in the learning comfort zone.

Hopefully by the end of the year, I will not only have enjoyed the journey but also to have grown more diverse with new interests and habits. 

## Choosing the learning subject
This was the fun part - endless possibilities without any of the hard work! 

These are the subjects that I decided on (subject to change):
* Health and body
    * Swimming (freestyle/front crawl)
    * Obstacle course race
    * Flexibility (squat)
* Culture and arts
    * Piano (jazz)
    * Painting (watercolour)
    * Poetry (writing)
* Intellect and mind
    * Chess
    * Philosophy
    * Programming
* Other (what a cop-out category, I know)
    * Calligraphy
    * Meditation
    * Writing (articles)
	
Deciding the exact scope and goal for each subject is postponed until it’s time to dive in.

## How to learn
In order to learn effectively, the first thing I did was to read *Ultralearning* by Scott Young, a book dedicated on how to approach learning projects like this one. 

For each learning project, Scott suggest to start by answering three basic questions: “Why?,” “What?,” and “How?”.  The “why” is about understanding the learning motivation, as it becomes easier to tailor and focus the project with this understanding. The “what” is about determining what knowledge and abilities you’ll need to learn to succeed. It’s helpful to split this into the following categories:

* Concepts (what need to be understood)
* Facts (what need to me memorised) 
* Procedures (what need to be practiced)

The “how” answers what learning resources and methods that should be used. There’s so many learning resources available online now so it’s easy to find curriculums and learning strategies that can be adapted to the particular project. 

Scott also suggest that a good rule of thumb is to invest approximately 10 percent of your total expected learning time into research prior to starting. So the first couple of days of the month is dedicated to planning the learning project and finding the right resources. 

Moreover, Ultralearning proposes a few key success factors:

* Focus: Am I focused when I spend time learning, or am I multitasking and distracted? 
* Directness: Am I learning the skill in the way I’ll eventually be using it? 
* Drill: Am I spending time focusing on the weakest points of my performance? 
* Retrieval: Can I successfully explain what I learned yesterday, last week, a year ago? How do I know if I can?
* Feedback: Do I know what I’m learning well and what I’m not?
* Retention: Do I have a plan in place to remember what I’m learning long term
* Intuition: Do I deeply understand the things I’m learning, or am I just memorizing? Could I teach the ideas and procedures I’m studying to someone else?
* Experimentation: How can I go beyond mastering the basics and create a unique style to solve problems creatively and do things others haven’t explored before?

I’ll try to incorporate these principles in each learning project along the year, as well as many other tips and tricks from the book such as:
* The easiest way to learn directly is to simply spend a lot of time doing the thing you want to become good at.
* Directly learning the thing we want often feels too uncomfortable, boring, or frustrating, so we settle for some book, lecture, or app, hoping it will eventually make us better at the real thing.
* Look for parts of the skill you’re learning that can be decomposed into specific moments of time that have heightened difficulty or importance and drill those.
* Cycling between direct practice and drills, even within the same learning session, is a good idea when you’re just starting out.


## Why even do something like this
I’ve been drawn to learning for as long as I can remember. Why? Maybe simply to compensate for a deep feeling of inadequacy and low self worth. I recently listened to an interview with Neil Pasricha on [The Knowledge Project](https://fs.blog/neil-pasricha/) podcast. The episode is about happiness, in which he proposes the following definition:

> “Happiness is the joy you feel while striving towards your potential”

This definition naturally resonates with me, since I devote a considerate amount of time to learning projects. In the very least, it serves as a good excuse to keep doing it. 

In the same episode, I recognised myself in a habit that he mentioned:  whenever someone (or I) say that they cannot do something, I always add “yet” at the end. I’m actively trying not to say it out loud as it sounds awfully pretentious. I’d like to think that this mental exercise fosters the Growth mindset coined by Carol Dweck. As the title of her [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve), it is “the power of believing that you can improve”, and is what allows us to to embark on a journey of lifelong learning.

Self-development is not entirely unproblematic however. Wanting to grow can also have a negative effect by placing unnecessary stress and expectations on ourselves. My last New Years resolution was to be kinder to myself, set fewer goals, and not always expect that I do something productive and meaningful. As with many new year resolutions, it didn’t last very long. I do believe that being able to enjoy the moment is probably equally important as “striving towards your potential” to be happy. What is a life but many moments in a long sequence, and the summing those moments ought to equal the total happiness. But constantly optimising for the short-term and “carpe diem” would likely plateau pretty soon.

I’ve recently rediscovered how awesome books are - especially in these times of short attention spans. We’re getting used to consuming bite sized pieces of information, through short videos, articles or tweets. A major problem for deeper learning is that they aren’t curated and presented in a thoughtful manner. Hence each bite-sized information must stand on its own and the depth and knowledge can’t build on previous concepts. Books however have the possibility of introducing several core concepts and ideas, and to build upon them to reach further. This project is a continuation of the same notion. Instead of getting tiny fragments of learning, I can immerse myself and go deeper than otherwise possible.

It’s fairly comfortable to learn about something. It’s harder to actually go through the process of learning it. I’ve come to realise that I mostly stay in my comfort zone of theory when I embark on a new learning venture. Golf is a prime example. After I started to golf, I read multiple books and watched countless hours of golf instruction videos online. I learned what to do. But I have spent a fraction of that time actually practicing and playing golf. Dare to guess how good I am at golf? Here’s a hint: not great.

> Passive learning creates knowledge. Active practice creates skill.

- Scott Young, Ultralearning

So a major challenge during this year will be to actually practice and gain new skills, rather than just gain new knowledge.

Let’s begin the learning journey!
